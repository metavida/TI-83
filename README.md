# metavida TI-83 Apps

This is an archive of a bunch of TI-83 apps & games that I wrote back in High School (circa 2002).

The code is not documented at all & I have no clue whether it works or not, but I do have fond memories of figuring out how to make my calculator do what I wanted it to!

Enjoy!
